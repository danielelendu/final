              <p>Nunez Live Bee removal is a family-owned buisness.We focus on safely
              removing bees, since they are such an important part of our environment.
            Since they are pollinators they are an important part of growing fresh produce.
          Once we remove the bees, we relocate the bees to a new hive so they can better
        our environment for more years to come. We also care about our cutomers space, and aim
      to repair any damages caused by these tiny creatures.</p>
      <p> We do not only work with bees, but also similar insects like bumblebees, wasps,
        yellow jackets, etc. </p>
        <p>We are able to repare damages on almost anything. We are familiar with different materials
        like drywall, brick, or wood. Sopme of the most common structures that need repairs are
        roofs, sididngs, walls, or even trees. Once we are done it will look as if nothing ever happened.
